    <h2>This Keyword</h2>
    <p>
        This is a keyword in js and has different value at different places.
        <ul>
            <li>'this' in global scope points to the 'Global Object' i.e in Chrome it points to 'window'</li>
            <li>'this' in the function points to UNDEFINED in strict mode.</li>
            <li>'this' in function points to 'Gloab Object' in NON-STRICT MODE because of 'this subsitution' (if this is pointing to undefined or null it will automatically points this to global object)</li>
            <li>'this' in method points to the object it is called with.</li>
            <li>'this' in  arrow functions points to its parents lexical environment.</li>
            <li>'this' in the DOM points to the element it is used with.</li>            
            
        </ul>
    </p>
