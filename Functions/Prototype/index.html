    <h1>Object Prototype</h1>
    <p>In js if we create an object and it has some properties we can access it by using the dot notation but if we check the object using the dot 
        notation in browser it also provides some other properties because every object has a Prototype and it has its own properties.
        So when the browser find the dot notation it tries to find the property in the object if it does not find it in the object then 
        it goes to the OBJECT PROTOTYPE and then again Prototype of the prototype until the property is found or NULL.
    </p>
